# AnnoyingToggl

## The Time Tracker That Won't Let You Forget (Because It's Annoying AF)

Ever forget to track your time on Toggl? Meet AnnoyingToggl – the app that turns procrastination into productivity through sheer irritation! This macOS gem sits in your menu bar, nagging you relentlessly until you log those precious hours. Because nothing says "I care about your productivity" like a persistent popup that won't go away.

### Features
- **Relentless Reminders**: Pops up every 15 minutes like that one friend who won't stop texting.
- **Toggl Integration**: Actually connects to your Toggl account (surprisingly useful).
- **Menu Bar Magic**: Lives quietly... until it doesn't.
- **SwiftUI Sorcery**: Built with Apple's latest witchcraft for that modern feel.

### Installation
1. Clone this repo (or don't, we won't judge).
2. Open `AnnoyingToggl.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Hit build and run. Boom! Annoyance achieved.

### Usage
1. Launch the app.
2. Enter your Toggl API key (we promise not to spam your email... much).
3. Get annoyed into productivity.
4. Profit? (Or at least tracked hours.)

### Contributing
Found a way to make it even more annoying? PRs welcome! Just don't make it too user-friendly – we need that edge.

### License
MIT – because even annoying apps deserve freedom.

*Remember: Time tracking is like flossing – nobody likes it, but you'll thank yourself later. Or not. Whatever.*
